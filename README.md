## Description
This is a quick application to create a README.md template. 
As README.md files often display similar formats and information, a Professional README Generator can save considerable time, which could be better spent on coding the new project. The Professional README Generator consists of a number of prompts for the Developer to answer and enter into the program. These responses are then written into a new README file.
